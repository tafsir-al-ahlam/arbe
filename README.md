I could see the many people inside the wish (like the lizard) as addressing facets of self. Since you are planning about becoming a homicide detective, the wish could also relate <a href="https://tafsiralahlaam.com/"> تفسيرالاحلام </a> solely to what you need to conquer and experience in order to pursue this target. If it is a faculty, I would seethe fantasy as featuring mean important lifestyle lessons I have to study.

This wish was yesterday evening.


This might be showing you that you need to focus on materialism, greed, knowledge you already have what you would like, and you may be attracted right now to anything that you do not genuinely need and are getting from your life's path in the process (your life is course being vehicles in this fantasy). This aspiration needs a fresh lifestyle and seems like too much is to be in effect within order to proceed forward.
